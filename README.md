The objective of the project is to create a scalable framework for Internet of Things (IoT) time series applications. The Arduino Uno R4 Wi-Fi, paired with a DHT11 humidity and temperature sensor, is used to broadcast environmental data from sensors. A client utilizing the MQTT protocol sends this data to EMQX, which serves as a MQTT broker. EMQX then forwards the data to a Kafka broker for streaming. The data is finally stored in an InfluxDB database to facilitate real-time event detection, aggregation, and offline analytics. The project includes the implementation of continuous queries to provide real-time alerts for temperature and humidity. Additionally, it offers a comprehensive solution for analyzing and visualizing environmental data using efficient query, indexing, and visualization techniques.
